My first repository
My name is Bill Ruben, full-time faculty for **Ivy Tech Community College** - South Bend/Elkhart.
I have been teaching for about 25 years in 3 community colleges and 1 university in the areas of Information Technology and Business Administration. Prior to that, I was a computer programmer/analyst in 3 other organizations. In addition, I've been involved in some private (family-based) consulting.
